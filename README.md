# Estimating Obesity Levels Exploration and Classification

## Overview 
This project involves estimating the obesity level of individuals from Mexico, Peru and Colombia and identifying the contributing factors of obesity levels.

## Dataset Information 

The project uses the Estimation of Obesity Levels dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset include data 16 attributes related to each indiviadual's personal record such as height, weight, etc and the target variable is obesity levels.
